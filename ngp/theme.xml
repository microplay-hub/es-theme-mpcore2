			<text>The Neo Geo Pocket is a 16-bit fifth generation handheld video game console with a monochrome display released by SNK in October 1998 in Japan. The device never saw a release outside of Japan and smaller Asian markets. Despite SNK's confidence in its library of games, in just a year the handheld was discontinued as it could not compete with the largely successful Game Boy Color, which not only had color but also saw a western release, and it was quickly succeeded by the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Only nine games were released for the system, but it was completely forward compatible with its successor.</text>
